The archive you are going to download contains the files from Version 4.1 and the other ones.

    PLEASE READ:

    NOTE: Feel free to extend or edit the layout as you like. If you'd like to upload your edits, please mention the original creator name  gosherfed  in the description.

    EXTRA NOTE (important for low-end devices): You may need more than 8GB of RAM to run this smoothly. In other words, you might want to upgrade your potato PC or just consider acquiring a powerful one, and here are the tips when you're in-game:

        -This layout contains a huge amount of vegetation, just to make the natural landscape look as realistic as possible, be sure to configure your render distance to NEAR, instead of NORMAL. This can (somehow) shorten the loading time, and prevent crashes.
        -If you're loading this layout on a low-end PC, try not to move around too quick (when you're not in miniature mode). On some devices the game even freezes and crashes as the layout doesn't have enough time to load while using up the RAM.
        -Try not to spawn too many objects while editing.
        -You can try Version 3.1. It contains much less details when consisting only 50% contents of the 4.1 (without the Connert Tasherag Route) so that your computer will be more likely to run it stably (and better FPS,too!).


Here are: How to install the mod!

    HOW TO INSTALL REMIL CONNERT 4.1 TO ROLLING LINE:
    -Download the .rar file, unpack it.
    -Choose one of the versions (latest is 4.1 and I recommend this), copy the Remil Connert folder (actually the folder name is misspelled to Remil Connerte) to the following path: (...:\...\Rolling Line\Modding\mods)  or you can copy to the Saves folder as well!
    -Launch the game and enjoy the layout!
